Pulled the repository from another computer this morning and discovered many problems. Especially since the machine I
was using then was Windows7 and Python3 was not supported and could not be installed on that machine. Therefore, I have
decided to once again work on the build tools and find another solution which can be used on the older Windows 7
machine. For now, since I am only targeting Windows builds, batch files should should get me back on track since I
want to spend more time on the engine and less on the build tools.
Completed a version of Test00_Logger to confirm proper project setup (with the revised build system) and check the
Logger functions. For now, logging to the console is accpetable. Later we will need to log to the buffered dispatcher
when we begin release builds or for logging inside the SgeCreator application. Will continue to refine build tools as
required.

Spent more time working on the premake build tools. Eliminated some deprecated methods and planning to add filters and
various refinements. Setup the project for testing the logger.

Setup the github repository and then cloned it with Visual Studio 2022. At this point I began following the youtube 
video series by "progremtic" for his Hippo engine. I am mainly interested in  his use of premake5 and Python tools so I
downloaded both premake5 and Python 3. Some of the methods he used did not seem to work with my installation of VS2022
so I made some changes in order to get the gensln.py, buildsln.py and run.py to work in my build environment. Also
since I am not intending to support non-windows platforms at this time, I did not test the cross-platform methods
he provides though they are included in my code. This will be the first time I use command line script tools to
manage my project. Ended the day by adding the static libraries to the premake5 build script. At this point Scavenger
will take a different development path than the progrematic's youtube series.
