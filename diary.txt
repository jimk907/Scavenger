2022-Jul-09
Setup the github repository and then cloned it with Visual Studio 2022. At this point I began following the youtube 
video series by "progremtic" for his Hippo engine. I am mainly interested in  his use of LUA and Python tools so I
downloaded both LUA and Python 3. Some of the methods he used did not seem to work with my installation of VS2022
so I made some changes in order to get the gensln.py, buildsln.py and run.py to work in my build environment. Also
since I am not intending to support non-windows platforms at this time, I did not test the cross-platform methods
he provides though they are included in my code. This will be the first time I use command line script tools to
manage my project. Ended the day by adding the static libraries to the premake5 build script. At this point Scavenger
will take a different development path than the progrematic's youtube series.
